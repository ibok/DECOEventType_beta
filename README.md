# DECOEventType_beta
python event classification script (unfinished)

## Script info

Run the script in the terminal or wherever else you prefer. The output is in the form [image id]:[event type].

The script is not completely accurate and is being improved. Currently the weighted accuracy is roughly 85 percent and the speed is about 2 seconds per jpeg image.

Note: Only .jpg and .jpeg images (caps work too) can be run using the script.
